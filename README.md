# Movie-Genre-Classification
This project aims to develop a machine learning model (Logistic Regression &amp; Decision Tree) to classify songs into genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) accurately. The system will analyze audio features such as danceability, energy, acoustic Ness, tempo, etc. and metadata to categorize songs into predefined genres.

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres, I will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I will first make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for sub setting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors I should be aware of when doing machine learning.

Next, I will use the scikit-learn package (Itâ€™s an open-source python library that that features various classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms.) to predict whether I can correctly classify a song's genre based on features. I will go over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
