This project aims to develop a machine learning model (Logistic Regression &amp; Decision Tree) to classify songs into genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) accurately. The system will analyze audio features such as danceability, energy, acoustic Ness, tempo, etc. and metadata to categorize songs into predefined genres.
